# Moment-SOS-Based-Fast-Risk-Estimation
Moment-Sum-Of-Squares Approach for Fast Risk Estimation in Uncertain Environments

**Description:**

We address the risk estimation problem where one aims at estimating the probability of violation of safety constraints for a robot in the presence of bounded uncertainties with arbitrary probability distributions. In this problem, an unsafe set is described
by level sets of polynomials that is, in general, a nonconvex set. Uncertainty arises due to the probabilistic parameters of the unsafe set and probabilistic states of the robot. To solve this problem, we use a moment-based representation of probability distributions. We describe upper and lower bounds of the risk in terms of a linear weighted sum of the moments. Weights are coefficients of
a univariate Chebyshev polynomial obtained by solving a sum-of-squares optimization problem in the offline step. Hence, given a finite number of moments of probability distributions, risk can be estimated in real-time. We demonstrate the performance of the provided approach by solving probabilistic collision checking problems where we aim to find the probability of collision of a robot with a non-convex obstacle in the presence of probabilistic uncertainties in the location of the robot and size, location, and geometry of the obstacle.
